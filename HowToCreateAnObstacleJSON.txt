Your standard obstacle JSON file will look like this:

{
  "obstacles": {
    <obstacle name>: {
      "type": <"static", "kinematic">,
      "x": <start x>,
      "y": <start y>,
      "width": <width>,
      "height": <height>,
      "angle": <angle>,
      "sprite": <path or link to desired sprite>        <-- If unspecified, defaults to static
    },
    ...
  }
}


You need to have all your obstacles enclosed in the "obstacles" array.

If "type" is set to kinematic, the following information is required:
  "speed": <speed>,                                     <-- If unspecified, defaulted from StaticUtilities
  "path": [                                             <-- If unspecified, will not move
    [x1, y1],                                           <-- At least two points required
    [x2, y2],
    ...
  ],                                                    <-- Uses brackets instead of braces
  "interpolation": <"linear", "cubic", "bezier">        <-- If unspecified, defaults to linear

Kinematic object will repeatedly move down the line of points and then back up.
If "interpolation" is set to "cubic", the path will be a cubic bezier spline.
If "interpolation" is set to "bezier", the path will be a bezier curve.
